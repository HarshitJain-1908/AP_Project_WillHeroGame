# AP_Project_WillHeroGame
Developed a clone of Will Hero Game as a course project in Advanced Programming offered at IIIT Delhi.
This was a group project of 2 members.
In this project, Object Oriented Programming is used as foundation of this project.
Javafx is used to put animation effects.
All the objects in the game (hero, orc, treasure chests, weapons, islands etc.) are instantiated as
per the objects of defined classes with legal states. 

It was a great learning and fun doing this project.
